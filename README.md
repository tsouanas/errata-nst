Errata for NST (Notes on Set Theory, 2nd Edition) by Y. N. Moschovakis

* ix, P3, L2: "LaTeXand" should be "LateX and"
* 2: four "<=>" should be "<=>_def"
* 3, mid-page math: "A --f--> B" should be "X --f--> Y"
* 8, Def2.6: better change "since \emptyset = ..." to "since \emptyset =_c
  ..." to match the definition (although "=" is correct too).
* 10, Thm2.13: delete trailing comma in sequence "(a_0, a_1, ...,)"
* 24 (and elsewhere): some periods right after axioms/numbers are boldface,
  others aren't
* 33, L5: "the fundamental theorem 2.21 of Cantor is about the set R of real
  numbers" <- it doesn't seem that way, it's about any set A;
  it is corollary 2.14 talks about R.
* 42, 4.20, L-3: decrease spacing before "!"
* 43, Ex4.26: increase spacing around "and" and/or substitute by "&"
* 49: problem x4.27 is marked as difficult, but it isn't; all its difficulty
  lies in problem x4.26 instead!
* 54, commas after (1) and (2): one is bold, the other one isn't.
* 55, 5.8: "5.6" missing?  Comapre with 5.5 in p.52.
* 56, 5.9, L9: The parenthesis seems weird.
* 59, 5.14, L10: add more space before "by (5-6)"
* 61, 5.18: One I.S. is "Induction step" the other one "Induction Step"
* 63: Get rid of the parentheses in cases to be consistent with p. 141.
* 74, 6.7, L8: change "!) " to "!)\ " to fix sentence-ending spacing
* 74, 6.7, L10: better end this line with ":".
* 75, 6.10, L3: make "chain-complete" bold (consistency with previous style)
* 75, 6.15: "6.2" should not be italics (compare with Exercise 6.4, p.73)
* 76, 6.18: seems like "\Rightarrow" was used instead of "\implies" (spacing
  is too tight)
* 76, 6.20: better use "\cdots" or "\dotsb"
* 79, 6.28, I.S.: There is no "h" anywhere, so why use a prime here?
  (rename all "h'"s to "h"s)
* 81, 6.31, L-2: "f(n+1)" should be "f(n+i)"
* 81, 6.33, (2): "divides evenly" -> "divides" ("evenly" is redundant here)
* 85, x6.12, L-2: closing "]" missing
* 85, 6.38, L-1: maybe replace "when" by "only when"?
* 93, 7.20: "injection" is redundant (see Exercise 7.13)
* 96, L-3: linebreak in math mode
* 96, L-2: `\leq` should be `\leq_P`
* 97, L2: `\leq` should be `\leq_P`
